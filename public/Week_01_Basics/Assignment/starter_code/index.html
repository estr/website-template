	<h4>Experience Designer</h4>
	<p>I'm an Experience Design consultant based in Sydney, with strengths in lightweight research and prototyping. The most fun I can have on a project is working closely with Product and Developers to build the right thing and build the thing right. The best thing about my job is getting things in front of customers quickly and seeing their reactions.</p>
